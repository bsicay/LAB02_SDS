    "# Day 1 - Prompting\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to the Kaggle 5-day Generative AI course!\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook will show you how to get started with the Gemini API and walk you through some of the example prompts and techniques that you can also read about in the Prompting whitepaper. You don't need to read the whitepaper to use this notebook, but the papers will give you some theoretical context and background to complement this interactive notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Before you begin\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, you'll start exploring prompts and prompt parameters using the Python SDK and AI Studio. For some inspiration, you might enjoy exploring some apps that have been built using the Gemini family of models. Here are a few that we like, and we think you will too.\n",
    "\n",
    "* [TextFX](https://textfx.withgoogle.com/) is a suite of AI-powered tools for rappers, made in collaboration with Lupe Fiasco,\n",
    "* [SQL Talk](https://sql-talk-r5gdynozbq-uc.a.run.app/) shows how you can talk directly to a database using the Gemini API,\n",
    "* [NotebookLM](https://notebooklm.google/) uses Gemini models to build your own personal AI research assistant.\n",

    "\n",
    "### A note on the Gemini API and Vertex AI\n",
    "\n",
    "In the whitepapers, most of the example code uses the Enterprise [Vertex AI platform](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai). In contrast, this notebook, along with the others in this series, will use the [Gemini Developer API](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/) and [AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/).\n",
    "\n",
    "Both APIs provide access to the Gemini family of models, and the code to interact with the models is very similar. Vertex provides a world-class platform for enterprises, governments and advanced users that need powerful features like data governance, ML ops and deep Google Cloud integration.\n",
    "\n",
    "AI Studio is free to use and only requires a compatible Google account to log in and get started. It is deeply integrated with the Gemini API, which comes with a generous [free tier](https://ai.google.dev/pricing) that you can use to run the code in these exercises.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are already set up with Google Cloud, you can check out the [Enterprise Gemini API](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/model-reference/inference) through Vertex AI, and run the samples directly from the supplied whitepapers."

       "\n",
       "The script modifies your shell prompt (`PS1`) to display information such as:\n",
       "\n",
       "* **Current branch:**  The name of the Git branch you're currently on.\n",
       "* **Upstream status:** Whether your local branch is ahead of, behind, or even with its remote tracking branch.  This is shown with symbols (often arrows) indicating the difference.\n",
       "* **Changes:**  A summary of changes you've made (staged, unstaged, untracked files).\n",
       "* **Virtual environment:** If you're using a virtual environment (like `venv` or `conda`), it will display the name.\n",
       "* **Customizable themes:**  The appearance (colors and symbols) can be customized using theme files.\n",

       "You'd use this script to improve your workflow with Git. By having the Git status visible directly in your prompt, you constantly see:\n",
       "\n",
       "* **Context:** You always know which branch you're working on.\n",
       "* **Progress:** You quickly see if there are any changes to commit, or if your local branch is out of sync with the remote. This minimizes accidental pushes of outdated code.\n",
       "* **Efficiency:**  You can avoid the need to manually run `git status` every few minutes.\n",
       "\n",
       "The script handles various edge cases and is designed to be compatible with both bash and zsh shells.  The extensive configuration options allow a high degree of customization to match your preferences and the look of your terminal.\n"
